1. Use the unique Id which was assigned to the user while registering to the game, don't create new one and also we can't depend up socket
connections as they are temporary. : fixed
2. Create game user based on their Ids (logic to send moves and create multiple game instance) : Done
3. try all moves and see if they are working as expected : Done (some part)
4. Join as spectator : DDone
5. try to send chats and sync that to others : Working

Tomorrow work:
1. Structure the code in better why and think of better solution for are functionalities 
2. Fix chat issue how you can make sure name you will get of a spectator and players
3. check all moves if they are working fine 
4. Store moves in DB (Directly for now)
5. create a proper function for sending or receiving moves
6. think of a proper schema for to send or receive message, move, chat etc
7. Quest mode when user is not login but still can watch games and play but moves will not store in DB
8. Webrtc connection how to establish or make stable also send to all spectators
9. Resume/reconnection functionaliity under 10s (think of time watch stop till the player comes and make the time watch sync with the game)
